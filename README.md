# Cloud Computing Resource Allocation System

## Overview
This project implements a resource allocation system for a cloud computing environment. The system efficiently allocates available resources based on user-defined priorities while ensuring the integrity of the resource structure.

## Key Components
### Data Structures
1. **Merkle Tree**: Maintains the integrity of the resource structure, allowing the system to verify if any tampering or changes have occurred.
2. **Priority Queue**: Manages the allocation of resources based on their priorities, ensuring the most suitable resource is selected for each allocation request.

### Combined Approach
By combining the Merkle Tree and Priority Queue, the system achieves efficient resource allocation while ensuring the security and integrity of the process.

## Time Complexity
### Merkle Tree Construction
- **Worst Case**: O(n log n)
- **Best Case**: O(n log n)

### Merkle Tree Update
- **Worst Case**: O(log n)
- **Best Case**: O(log n)

### Priority Queue Operations
- **Adding a resource**:
  - **Worst Case**: O(log n)
  - **Best Case**: O(1)
- **Removing a resource**:
  - **Worst Case**: O(log n)
  - **Best Case**: O(1)

## Space Complexity
- **Merkle Tree**: O(n)
- **Priority Queue**: O(n)
- **Overall**: O(n)

## System Workflow
1. **Initialization**: Construct the Merkle Tree with the available resources.
2. **Resource Addition**: Add resources to the Priority Queue and update the Merkle Tree.
3. **Resource Allocation**: Allocate resources based on their priority using the Priority Queue.
4. **Integrity Verification**: Verify the integrity of the resource structure using the Merkle Tree.
